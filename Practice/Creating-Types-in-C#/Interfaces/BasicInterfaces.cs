  /// An interface is a contract that says "if you want to be THIS type of thing,
  /// you MUST be able to do THESE specific things"
  /// 
  /// Here's the classic IEnumerator from System.Collections - perfect example!
  /// It says "if you want to be enumerable, you must know how to move next,
  /// what your current item is, and how to reset yourself"
  /// </summary>

    object Current { get; } // Read-only Property - what's the current item?
    void Reset();         // Method - can you go back to the beginning?

    // Notice: NO implementation here, just the contract
    // Notice: NO access modifiers - interface members are implicitly public
    // Notice: NO fields allowed - interfaces define behavior, not data
